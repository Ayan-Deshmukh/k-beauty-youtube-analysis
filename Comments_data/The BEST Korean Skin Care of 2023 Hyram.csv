I wanted to share my experience with red light therapy, specifically using a panel from Future Form Official, which my dermatologist suggested. I've been using it for the past six months, and it's truly transformed my skin's complexion and significantly reduced my wrinkles. The panel is surprisingly affordable, making it accessible for those of us looking for effective skincare without hefty costs. At 46, I often get mistaken for being much younger now, which feels fantastic. There are numerous scientific papers supporting the benefits of red light therapy, so it's great to see real results backed by science.

I personally love the Blue Lizard Sensitive 50+spf mineral sunscreen. It definitely has a white cast at first but does tend to blend in after while. This is just what works for me, so for others curious to try this, just know you might not like it and that's okay! For further reference, I am a Hispanic/Latina light-medium/golden-olive-ish skin tone. I occasionally experience breakouts around my chin and nose during my period, but otherwise I do not. Like I said I have normal to dry skin but depending on the weather it can be very dry without skincare.
