Ceramide Blemish Treatment Gel with 5 Ceramides, Salicylic Acid & Niacinamide Ceramide Blemish Gel Moisturiser again with the 5 Ceramides, Salicylic Acid & Niacinamide. Polypeptide Fusion Cream with the press/pump packaging. My combination, but reactionary skin really likes them so far. While I have dry and oily areas, too rich of a facial oil or moisturiser will give me a rash and spots. My skin hates Hyaluronic Acid which is now in everything. Delighted when I saw those bits in Lidl and Salicylic Acid and Niacinamide always stood out to me as favourites of mine. I still love a physical exfoliator. Every 3 or 4 days. Sometimes I will only use toner/moisturisers so I thankfully am not over doing it with actives elsewhere. I am running out of my current skincare stock. The plan is to just get Korean skincare bits, instead of say my usual Garnier Peeling Micellar Water. I do love that one and I like the blue oily one for make up removal. Anyways top of the list is that sebum stuff and the little device. Been in my basket for going on a year. I got the Beauty Bay Korean Skincare box for like 50ish euro (40ish pounds I think) to try a few other bits out before buying full sizes. I‚Äôm excited to put in an order for all these bits I‚Äôve been seeing for months.

SFs are a natural part of your skin's anatomy, which can't be removed entirely. In contrast, blackheads are a form of acne caused by sebum and dead skin cells clogging your pores, and those CAN be removed in a few different ways. It's recommended to leave SFs alone, as squeezing can lead to irritation, infection, or scarring. But! You can totallyyy make them appear less visible with a consistent skincare routine (pore-clearing cleansers, low % exfoliants, retinoids, niacinamide, and all the usual guys). If you're unsure whether you're looking at sebaceous filaments or blackheads on your own face, you can Google something like 'sebaceous filaments vs blackheads' to check and compare the two! For the longest time, I thought that I had HEAPS of blackheads on my chest & boobs haha, but turns out they're just sebaceous filaments, and their appearance can be amplified when you're either not cleansing your skin correctly, or also just using the wrong products for your particular skin type and concerns! Once I started using products that weren't so BHA, etc, heavy on that area, and just consistently used products that cleansed my pores properly (adding in an exfoliant when needed), that's when I finally started noticing a massive difference! But then, even if you are using the ILSO product for its intended purpose, everybody's skin is different, and so many factors go into whether a product might or might not work for you! Not just your skin type/concerns, but stuff like the climate where you live, pollution, how much you do or don't sweat in a day, and your daily environment to name a few! ü©∑üçé So TL;DR, if you're trying to treat your sebaceous filaments as blackheads, you're probably going to make your skin worse! and I guess vice versa? and X product might work for one person, but also might not for another with the same skin type/concern; a lot of factors come into play other than your skin's anatomy and concerns like acne etc. üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄ",UCU2qrsiPkpvEzvi3GtcoigA,http://www.youtube.com/@cabletiehandcuffs,1,UgyTdIB_DT3lvCx0NMV4AaABAg,@ri8731
