My husband has way bigger pores than I do, but some of his family members do have pretty tiny pores.

I can still 100% tell when they are wearing makeup in person, online/in photos yeah of course it's easy to do subtle things and think there's nothing there.

Whatever you talk about other races or groups that you are not a part of, you tend to generalize and stereotype these groups, and in such an excessive way that is genuinely harmful to the communities that you are praising. I understand that you are educated in a lot of things, but as an esthetician myself, I know for a fact that I didn‚Äôt learn enough in school about BIPOC skin and it was considered a specialty, and that was only six years ago. I don‚Äôt know exactly what education you have had since leaving school, so I cannot speak for your education, however, based on the way you are talking about Korean people in this video, it feels like you are mystifying them in a way, making them seem better than human, and that can actually the human eyes people, and make others see them as not a person who deserves respect or privacy. Saying that Koreans all have amazing skin and diets and it‚Äôs like that for everyone in South Korea (paraphrasing), is not only setting unrealistic standards, but also false information. I know that seems like a stretch, but it is some thing that I have seen, especially with how people of other backgrounds fetishize the Asian community so much because they are viewed as almost ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. I know you‚Äôve been to Korea twice, but as also a fellow San Fran girlie, it‚Äôs like someone going to San Francisco twice as a tourist, asking random ass people on the street as well as some of the top skincare providers about the culture of San Francisco (could be San Fran skin routines or hair care or daily life or culture, whatever), and then coming back and speaking to tens of thousands of people about how this is what ALL people from San Francisco do and how they live. San Francisco is a big city full of so many people with different ways of life, and no one would be able to know what an entire city and their people are like. And that‚Äôs just a city. You are generalizing an entire country. I cannot speak for the actual Korean and Asian individuals, however, I can see that a number of butterflies who love and respect you are telling you that this is not okay and that you are generalizing.

Even the old village women working in the fields wear long sleeves and big hats. Sun visors and umbrellas in the cities. And dryer skin, less tendency to acne. But also obviously compared to North American women generally, they are slimmer. And they obviously have thick shiny straight hair that grows long or holds a geometric cut well. Plus there's often culturally learned ""girlish"" or ""ladylike"" manners, grace and precision in movement. All of this is kind of the opposite of me :) but the skin care products are fantastic and the makeup tips very clever. That said, the K-pop idols have all clearly done plastic surgery, mainly eyelids, noses and jawlines I surmise. And many online influencers are filtered out of recognition.

There are many people in Korea who don't look at all like what the media portrays. Many people are overworked working 60+ hours of work a week and still having a hard time making ends meet. When I finished high school my parents gifted me a nose, eyelid, and v-.line surgery so I would look nicer and have better opportunities at finding a job when graduating. In Korea, we have to submit our headshots with applications as well as our height and weight and many things that is never submitted here in America. I was so shocked when I started looking for work and learned that you don't do those things here. I had friends who were not so fortunate to have those surgeries gifted to them by their parents, and sadly those friends still struggle to this day in society.

What I want to add should not be taken to contradict any of what you are saying because your point about the different attitudes towards appearance (I particularly think about the differences over plastic surgery and using head shots as part of a job application when trying to capture the cultural differences), I want to point out that some of the differences most Americans see are *not* coming from those particular places but rather from seeing a particular subset of Korean people. If one sees Korean people in the same situations as Americans (as an American, for example, do you see them at work and in the shops? Do you see them relaxing with friends and at home?) then one can make a judgement. If someone watches K-drama and YouTube‚Ä¶sigh. Keep in mind that Cassandra is unusually, refreshingly honest about her skin compared to many YouTubers. I cannot tell the difference between the skin of an average Korean person and the skin of an average American, myself. If I were basing my opinion of Americans on what I saw from influencers or from Hollywood, I would say, ‚ÄúWhy do Americans have such great skin?‚Äù etc. Plus, it‚Äôs not even fair to say this about Korean women - this is holding an entire nation of women up to some impossible standard! What if American women were greeted by disappointed faces everywhere because we had normal skin?! My Korean clients, too, think I am 10-15 years younger than I am and say that American kids look so young; I think that is partially because they are used to seeing actors playing young people, like a 23 year old person playing a high schooler. I think this is showing that we all fall victim to stereotyping groups we only know about through the media. The women I work with mostly use American brands of skin care but they may also use Korean, Japanese, or French brands. There is a lot of Oil of Olay, a lot of random stuff from Trader Joe‚Äôs or Whole Foods - your basic bathroom setup in other words. The women I know generally don‚Äôt wear makeup around the house or with friends, and many of them don‚Äôt wear any makeup at their jobs as scientists or doctors, but if they have a meeting for their children‚Äôs school or an evening social event they will get dressed up and then their skin does look amazing. In general, I find their appearance is much like the American women in our community, or perhaps the Korean women wear a little less makeup. In 20 years of this job, I have seen enough to say that Korean women have the same skin as women in literally every other similarly situated country I personally know about. Korean women in the media do have much better skin than the average American woman. Then again, American women in the media have much better skin than the average Korean woman. There just isn‚Äôt some Korean magic - and I say this despite loving my job and the friends it has brought into my life. I am deeply appreciative for the kindness and generosity of the people with whom I work, some of whom have worked for skin care companies and given me amazing products as gifts over the years. Korean skin care is really great and my skin loves it. Appreciation of beauty products is great. Appreciation of history is great. Appreciation of culture is great. But there is a real ick in turning that into some kind of (inaccurate) beauty stereotype.",UComJpJSfA9Pc5YFh3tqwdVw,http://www.youtube.com/@nimue325,1,UgxmK6fJM7tnVupmlEJ4AaABAg,@user-bd9uo8dw3j
