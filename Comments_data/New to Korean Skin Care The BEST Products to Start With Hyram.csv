I'm a 44 year old woman with oily, acne prone and textured skin who is a new K-beauty convert...I currently use Agency tretinoin treatment for anti-aging and I enjoy, as a complement to my anti-aging skincare products from Agency, the Snail Rescue purifying face wash from Peach Slices (I think they may be affiliated with Peach and Lily), but Peach Slices regardless, is a Korean brand. I've also used the Peach Slices Snail Rescue oil-free moisturizer, which is fabulous and super lightweight. I also have the Peach Slices Snail Rescue Blemish Busting toner....all of this Snail Rescue line contains 95% snail mucin concentrate and I've enjoyed using this toner to calm my skin as well from the tretinoin, as the Snail Rescue products also contain Centella and tea tree oil. For my sunscreen, I had to go with an Asian sunscreen due to their superior filters and luxurious feel, because nobody wants a tretinoin sunburn from an inferior sunscreen. I rotate between the (Korean) Biore UV Aqua Rich weightless moisturizer w broad spectrum SPF 50, which is great because it does double duty as both my SPF and provides moisture for my oily skin without having to apply two separate products and THEN apply makeup and a bunch of other products to my face as I do most days. The only downside to the Biore UV Aqua Rich is that it's NOT water-resistant and there are plenty of days when I sweat, either from the dry heat where I live (Las Vegas, NV) or from indoor heating, heat styling, hormonal changes, you name it. I found a great water resistant sunscreen that I've been loving (it was recommended by Dr. Jenny Liu here on YouTube), and it's the Kose Suncut UV Perfect Essence SPF 50 PA++++. It's water resistant, moisturizing enough to act as my AM moisturizer and behaves beautifully under makeup....which by the way, I'm next going to purchase the very viral Tir Tir Red Cushion foundation and also,I believe you may have influenced me to try the Haruharu Wonder Black Rice moisture cleanser.

By only using a stick sunscreen, you're applying less than the 2mg/cm¬≤ at which SPF tests are done! THIS MEANS YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE FULL PROTECTION MARKED ON THE LABEL. The amount of protection that you get from your sunscreen highly depends on the amount you're using. For your entire face, it's regularly around 2 finger lenghts worth of lotion sunscreen (and 1 additional one for your neck). You probably should also reapply your sunscreen every two hours if you're staying in the sun for a while (this is where a stick sunscreen really shines, bc they're so easy to use). Although MOST IMPORTANTLY, the best protection against UV damage is sun avoidance (try not to stand in direct sunlight when possible, even when wearing sunscreen!).

Just be sure your cleanser isn‚Äôt stripping the oils of your skin! Question 4: yes! After I wash my face I use ISNTREE Hyaluronic acid sunscreen, and then I use the Abib sunscreen stick throughout the day (I work outside 10+ hours a day and my skin doesn‚Äôt get irritated with using two different sunscreens. But pls do patch tests to be sure you aren‚Äôt allergic to any of the products). Question 5: you can use a different moisturizer at night if you want to! I use a creamier/thicker moisturizer at night so my skin is hydrated, but for my morning moisturizer I use a light weight one so it‚Äôs not heavy when I keep reapply sunscreen throughout the day :) hope this helps!",UCikFRwuikQ5vlNLkdo3qBdg,http://www.youtube.com/@YippieYerpPerkyJerk,1,Ugx6dAAlPBMpwIray2t4AaABAg,@starrynight519

Cleansing oils and balms both work great in taking off makeup. Personally I own a cleansing oil, a cleansing balm, and a water-based cleanser. When I'm at home I usually use the cleansing oil first and a water-based cleanser second, and when I travel (which is quite often bc my family lives 3h away) I take the balm with me since it's so handy for travel, no spills lol. You could buy an oil if you want and rotate between that and the balm, just to see what you like üôÇ",UCx5wyp1nISQvFULDZnVZwgw,http://www.youtube.com/@lauraanderson8785,1,UgzSNRcT9zp12Im7gQZ4AaABAg,@eb3340
