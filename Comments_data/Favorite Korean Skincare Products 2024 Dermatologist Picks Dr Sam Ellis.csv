I just wonder if you are using some kind of foundation but I think you don't need that. Your skin is fantastic even without anything on it, especially your neck. I have seen many dermatologist's videos and nobody has that kind of smooth and wrinclefree neck as you have. I am really impressed. If I may ask you something: I am 71 and do not use any kind of makeup, just lipstick. My skin is normal to dry and I wonder what kind of cleanser shall I use.

I did some digging and found that to get a ++++ rating, a sunscreen only has to have a Persistent Pigment Darkening (PPD) rating of 16 but an effective PPD is going to be a lot higher than that (for example, a lot of EU sunscreens have at least twice that PPD). Beauty of Joseon has the minimum PPD rating. I loved the feel of the formula and it was so gentle on my combo, type 2 rosacea skin, but I quickly developed pigmentation that had previously been controlled using a zinc-based SPF 50 (Pipette). I made sure I was applying enough BoJ and making sure to reapply, but to no avail. I'm currently trying and liking Dr.G Green Mild Up Sun+, which is a Korean zinc-based formula for sensitive skin. It seems to be really calming to my skin, especially when I don't use moisturizer under it. My skin also feels softer at the end of the day when I wash it off (I had this same effect with BoJ). It has some botanical antioxidants and visible light filters and such a nice satin finish- not too dry or matte, but also not dewy. It feels light for a zinc based formula. It does have a light white cast that disappears after awhile, but I'm fair so that's not a big deal for me. So far it seems to be holding its own in the pigmentation suppression department but Im curious to see how it holds up in the middle of summer.",UC1aJLBT-iWnNUV4ZFtny6PA,http://www.youtube.com/@ammonitelight,0,,
